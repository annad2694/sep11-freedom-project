How you have been learning your tool

What your FP goal is for winter break; be specific!

i have watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_ec3eowFLQ video because it is similar to the game i want to make, it makes it through js and i intend to use some js features. from the last blog i also said i have been expirementing timing using both wait() in Kaboom and setTimeout() in JavaScript to see how the game reacts which you can see from  to build the objects will be easy but i wanted to test out the timing in the game firs because the game will have to know when to reset and make the player choose again to play. so here is an example code with how that is going on so far. I have figured out the setTimout () but I dont know how to make the wait () work so I just put it in as JS. I had learned that setTimeout is not specific to Kaboom and actually the wait () is the one I needed to use. At first I,

Over the past two weeks, I have been learning my tool in a lot of different ways. I actually found a video on YouTube demonstrating how to build exactly what I want to make using JavaScript, which I plan on incorporating a little bit of in my final Freedom Project. From the last blog, I also said that I have been experimenting with timing using both `wait()` in Kaboom and `setTimeout()`. [These can be searched up in the "Info" or "Timer" sections](https://kaboomjs.com/) To build the relative objects needed for my game will be easy, so I wanted to test out the timing in the game first because the game needs to know when to reset and make the player choose again to play. The first time experimenting with it, I figured out how to use `setTimeout()`, but I didn’t know how to make `wait()`. Just a couple of days ago, I learned that `setTimeout()` is not specific to Kaboom, and that `wait()` is actually the one I needed to use. Because of this, I referred directly to Kaboom.js and incorporated it into the code I already had, completely removing `setTimeout()`. So, here is an example of the initial code, which works.
