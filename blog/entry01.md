I had decided to use [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro) for my Freedom Project mostly because it was between Kaboom and jQuery, and last year a classmate of mine had told me that they have done jQuery and it was relatively hard, and I don't feel that comfortable in my skills yet.  

So far, I’ve been [experimenting](https://github.com/annad2694/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md) with Kaboom by testing out the basics and seeing how different parts of the code work together. I started with small things, like changing the **background color** and creating **buttons**, just to get a feel for how objects and visuals appear on the screen. Then I moved on to making **text appear and disappear**, which helped me understand how to control timing in the game.  

After that, I began tinkering with the **game logic** itself, especially **arrays, loops, and functions**. For example, I created a **pattern array** for the Simon Says game and tested how it grows each round, and I experimented with timing using both `wait()` in Kaboom and `setTimeout()` in JavaScript to see how the game reacts. [These can be searched up in the "Info" or "Timer" sections](https://kaboomjs.com/).  

I also applied what I’ve learned in class about **functions and arrays** to make the computer remember and extend the sequence each round.  

Through all of this, I’ve been connecting little pieces of **JavaScript** I already knew to Kaboom, testing different ways things work, and figuring out how to make the game respond correctly. Each time I try something new: like controlling messages, timing, or the game pattern -- I learn more about how the engine works and how I can use it for my project.  

I plan to make something like a **Simon Says memory game** where a sequence of colors will appear and you must remember it, and each round there are more numbers; however, you only click the sequence if Simon tells you to.

### EDP

As of late, I believe I'm on the first two steps of the **engineering design process**, which is **defining** and **researching**. So far, we have been living **JavaScript** for our end-of-the-year project, so relatively, I am defining what I will be including inside my project/animation to make it work using JavaScript, but I'm also further conducting research on my tool to see how to incorporate it to make my **single-player game** function.  

To start ahead on how I will move forward to the next stage of the engineering design process, which is **brainstorming solutions**, I plan to further expand my project and make it go beyond by actually testing out and trying to make parts of the code function, so I would be brainstorming solutions to current things that don't exactly work.

### Skills

I understand that the point of **SEP** is to equip me with a strong set of skills that can be used anywhere, so in further halfway the development of how I'm going to apply outside skills that may even become useful to my project, or **time management** and **organization**, which I will use interchangeably.  

Since this is my first blog, there aren't any previous skills; however, I have started working on these recently. For example, for **time management**, I realized that I had been a little behind, and from that, I saw how I could struggle trying to keep up with work, so I want to make sure that I get all the **assignments and deadlines** done before they're due, as well as working towards **organization** by making sure that all of these assignments are done, and then check I can together all use them to complete my Freedom Project and anything that I might need to do in other classes.  

I am conveying my learning by reflecting on the skills I’m developing, like **time management** and **organization**, and explaining how I apply them to my project and classwork. Writing about my process helps me track growth and improve my habits.
