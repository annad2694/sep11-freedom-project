## Timeline

#### MVP
<b>Front End (what the player sees)</b>
* Establish a dark background with a centered layout. (3/1)
* Make four colored rectangular buttons (red, blue, green, yellow). (3/5)
* User clicks buttons and that button turns white (flash) for a second, so the user knows that the computer accepted their input. (3/10)
* On screen text "Correct" or "Incorrect" after input. (3/15)
<b>Back End (Tool+JS)</b>
* After initilizing Kaboom with the background (first step), use rect(), pos(), colorize(), and anchor() to create and make the buttons look neat. (3/1)
* Code using Kaboom to detect user's input on each of the buttons. Such as area() and onClick(). (3/5)
* Use wait() to make it less messy to insert the time to about 1 second for the button flashes or else animations will be out of order. (3/15)
* Use an array and choose() to create the randomly generated pattern and to restart the round after the click. (3/20)

<b>Beyond MVP</b>
* Instead of one continous round, increase the sequence each round to make it more challanging.
* Make it so that when the user gets the sequence incorrect that they must redo the simulation all over again ( use scene()) & show message when sequence is wrong.
* Maybe add a level or score system to display current winnings.
* If possible add sound effects to match the dictations of the game.
